##  Vpsa

Vpsa allows your Kubernetes cluster to connect to VPSA. For each Vpsa having `spec.csi` specified, Operator will automatically deploy a CSI Driver, and create sample Storage Classes (Block and NAS for each Storage Pool on that VPSA).
```shell script
kubectl get vpsas
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: Vpsa
metadata:
  name: example-vpsa
spec:
  hostname: "example.vpsas.zadara.com"
  https: true
  token: "EXAMPLETOKEN-1234"
  # csi: if defined, run CSI driver and connect to VPSA
  csi:
    provisioner: "csi.zadara.com"
    iscsiMode: "rootfs"
    # livenessProbe: k8s built-in, some fields omitted
    livenessProbe:
      periodSeconds: 5

```

#### Spec
Field | Description | Notes
------|-------------|------
`spec` | VpsaSpec defines the desired state of Vpsa |
`spec.hostname` | Hostname of the VPSA | Required
`spec.https` | Use https connection to the VPSA (default: http) | Required
`spec.token` | Token of the VPSA | Required
`spec.csi` | CSI provisioner |
`spec.csi.iscsiMode` | A way for the CSI plugin to reach iscsiadm on host https://github.com/zadarastorage/zadara-csi#node-iscsi-connectivity | Required. Allowed values: `"rootfs"`, `"client-server"`
`spec.csi.provisioner` | CSI provisioner to be used in StorageClass, for example `csi.zadara.com`. More: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#provisioner |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe` | Liveness probe configuration for CSI driver. Default livenessProbe.handler is httpGet: {path:"/healthz", port:9808}. Note: livenessProbe.handler MUST be httpGet, with path "/healthz". Other options not allowed. livenessProbe.handler.port is configurable (default 9808) and MUST be unique for each CSI instance. More: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.failureThreshold` | Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1. |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` | Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.periodSeconds` | How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1. |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.successThreshold` | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup. Minimum value is 1. |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds` | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes |

`spec.csi.livenessProbe.exec.command` | Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('\|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy. |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.httpGet` | HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform. |
`spec.csi.livenessProbe.httpGet.host` | Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead. |

##  AppDefinition

AppDefinition allows to define which Kubernetes resources compose an Application, as a logical unit. This is done by means of namespaces and label-based selectors. The result of the query should include workloads (e.g Deployments, StatefulSets), RBAC, configuration (Secrets, ConfigMaps), storage, and all other resources required for the application to run.
```shell script
kubectl get appdefinitions
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppDefinition
metadata:
  name: cassandra-test
spec:
  namespace: "default"
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: "cassandra"

```

##  SnapshotPolicy

SnapshotPolicy defines frequency for ApplicationSnapshots to be taken, and retention policy for cleaning up old ApplicationSnapshots.
```shell script
kubectl get snapshotpolicies
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: SnapshotPolicy
metadata:
  name: daily-snapshot-for-month
spec:
  # schedule: either cron expression or "on-demand"
  # various extended cron syntax options are supported:
  #  slash notation: */10, */5
  #  predefined schedules: @daily, @hourly, ...
  #  weekdays and months: SUN,MON,TUE,... JAN,FEB,MAR,...
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  keepLast: 7

```

`status.ready` | Snapshot policy is ready to use |
##  SnapshotConfiguration

SnapshotConfiguration allows to select application resources which must be included in ApplicationSnapshot (using namespace and labels), and to attach Snapshot Policies to the application (including Persistent Volumes on VPSA). Additionally, it provides information about all Application Snapshot created for this SnapshotConfiguration.
```shell script
kubectl get snapshotconfigurations
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: SnapshotConfiguration
metadata:
  name: dr-us-west-snapshot
spec:
  appDefinition: cassandra-test
  policies:
    - "daily-snapshot-for-month"
    - "weekly-snapshot-for-year"

```

#### Spec
Field | Description | Notes
------|-------------|------
`spec` |  |
`spec.appDefinition` | Application Definition for the snapshot | Required
`spec.policies` | Snapshot policies, defining when ApplicationSnapshots should be taken | Required

#### Status
Field | Description | Notes
------|-------------|------
`status` |  |
`status.policies` | All policies mentioned in Spec with lists of all the related ApplicationSnapshots |
`status.ready` | Snapshot configuration is ready to use |
`status.state` | State of the Snapshot Configuration can be one of the following: Idle - No Application Snapshots using this configuration were created. Active - All Application Snapshots using this configuration were created successfully. Failed - Some Application Snapshots using this configuration are in failed state. | Required. Allowed values: `"Idle"`, `"Active"`, `"Failed"`
##  CloneConfiguration

CloneConfiguration allows to specify which ApplicationSnapshot must be restored. Additionally, it allows to set destination namespace and renaming pattern for restored resources.
```shell script
kubectl get cloneconfigurations
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: CloneConfiguration
metadata:
  name: dr-us-west-clone
spec:
  appSnapshot:
    # references to metadata.name of ApplicationSnapshot
    name: "mysql-snap-2020-01-26"
  dryRun: false
  prefix: "clone-"
  suffix: ""
  targetNamespace: "test"

```

#### Spec
Field | Description | Notes
------|-------------|------
`spec` |  |
`spec.dryRun` | Run clone configuration checks only (default: false) |
`spec.prefix` | Prefix to add to cloned resources (default: "clone-") |
`spec.suffix` | Suffix to add to cloned resources (default: "") |
`spec.targetNamespace` | Target namespaces to clone to | Required
`spec.appClone` | Application Clone name (default: Prefix + AppSnapshot.Name + Suffix) |

##  Invoker

Invoker activates SnapshotConfiguration or CloneConfiguration. When SnapshotConfiguration is invoked, Operator will create a CronJob (for recurring Snapshot Policies), or a Job (for on-demand policy), which will create a new ApplicationSnapshot. When CloneConfiguration is invoked, Operator will create a new ApplicationClone object, eventually causing ApplicationSnapshot to be cloned. Deleting Invoker is an equivalent to stopping a SnapshotPolicy, or a cloning process (Application Snapshots or Clones will not be deleted).
```shell script
kubectl get invokers
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: Invoker
metadata:
  name: mysql-daily-backup
spec:
  # one-of: snapshotConfiguration | cloneConfiguration
  snapshotConfiguration:
    name: "dr-us-west-snapshot"

```

##  ApplicationClone

ApplicationClone is an internal resource, created by Operator. It includes a list of all restored Kubernetes resources and VPSA Volumes, and provides information about restore status for each item. When ApplicationClone is created, Operator starts cloning VPSA Volumes, and restoring Kubernetes resources, from the ApplicationSnapshot.
```shell script
kubectl get applicationclones
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationClone
metadata:
  name: cassandra-2009-02-09--19-52-14-clone
spec:
  # reference to metadata.name of CloneConfiguration

`status.state` | State of the ApplicationClone | Required. Allowed values: `"Pending"`, `"Creating"`, `"Created"`, `"Failed"`, `"Deleting"`
##  ApplicationSnapshot

ApplicationSnapshot is an internal resource, created by Operator. It includes all Application metadata (such as Deployment, StatefulSet, ConfigMap, PersistentVolumeClaim, and other Kubernetes resources) and Snapshots of Data, stored on VPSA. When ApplicationSnapshot is created, Operator creates snapshots of VPSA Volumes, and stores serialized Kubernetes resources in the ApplicationSnapshot. ApplicationSnapshot can appear only in one CloneConfiguration at the same time (User can't clone the same ApplicationSnapshot twice).
```shell script
kubectl get applicationsnapshots
```

#### Example YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: zadara.com/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSnapshot
metadata:
  name: cassandra-2009-02-09--19-52-14
spec:
  vpsas:
    - name: "example-vpsa"
      provisioner: "csi.zadara.com"
      snapshots:
        - cg: "vol-0000001"
  # JSON (or YAML) of all app's API objects
  apiObjects:
    - "{\"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\"items\": [{\"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\"kind\": \"ConfigMap\",\"metadata\": {..."
    - "{\"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\"items\": [{\"apiVersion\": \"apps\v1\",\"kind\": \"Deployment\",\"metadata\": {..."
  # SnapshotConfiguration parameters (not necessary, helps for readability and debug)
  snapshotConfiguration: "dr-us-west-snapshot"

```
